MY GRADUATION PROJECT
A Gaming Recommendation System
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a gaming enthusiast, I understand how challenging it can be to find the right game to play. That's why I created this app to help gamers discover new and exciting games based on their preferences. With the advanced recommendation system, users can find games that fit their unique playing style, making the gaming experience more enjoyable.

I'm excited to showcase my latest project - a gaming recommendation system mobile app built using the Flutter framework. The app utilizes Firebase Firestore as the database, providing a seamless and scalable experience. To enhance app performance, I used Flutter Riverpod as the state management system.Finally,  the recommendation model was integrated with the mobile app using Flask.

NOTE: The recommendation model itself and the integration using Flask, wasn't done by me. It was done by my colleague Omar Emad.
